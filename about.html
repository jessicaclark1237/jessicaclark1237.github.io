        <div class="about-content">
            When I'm not busy scurrying around the hospital, I enjoy winding down with my watercolor set in  hand. My favorite mediums to work with are watercolor and acrylics. Aside from art, I enjoy knitting, reading, and enjoying nature. I hope to one day learn how to underwater basket weave!
